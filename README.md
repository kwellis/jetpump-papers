# Jet Pump Papers
The following is an area to host literature written by Kaelin Ellis on jet pumps in oil wells. Documents are a project write up for Kaelin's Masters in Petroleum Engineering from the University of Alaska Fairbanks and a paper written for the Society of Petroleum Engineers. Both discuss optimization of power fluid in a network of jet pump oil wells.
